# Ecosystems
An “ecological civilization” includes natural and built environments, health, education, equity, ethics, safety, justice, beauty. Instead of reducing the problems to the bubbles of the surface (effects, fragmented, taken for granted issues), problems should be defined and dealt with in the core of the “boiling pot” in view of a holistic, ecosystemic framework.
